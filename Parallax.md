### Digression on parallax

Note that the only *direct* method of determining distances to stars (and other celestial bodies) is based on the old concept of **parallax**--the angle between the lines of sight of a star from two different positions of the observer. The lines of sight and the line connecting the observer's positions for a triangle, with the star at the apex, as shown in Figure 1.1. The larger the distance to the object, the wider the baseline required for obtaining a discernible parallax: for objects within the solar system, distant points on Earth suffice; for stars, a much larger baseline is needed. This is provided by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, yielding a maximal baseline of ~3×10<sup>11</sup> m, twice the Earth-Sun distance _a_(= 1 AU). Thus, the stellar parallax is obtained by determining a star's position relative to very distant, fixed stars, at an interval of half a year. Even so, the triangle obtained is very nearly isosceles, with almost right base angles, while the parallax _p_, defined as half the apex angle, is less than 1" (the largest known stellar parallax is that of Promixa Centauri--the star closest to our Sun, _p = 0".75_). Consequently, to a good approximation, _d ≈ a/p_. Based on this method, distances of up to about 500 light-years may be directly measured. (One light-year, 94.6x10<sup>15</sup> m, is the distance tranvelled in one year at the speed of light.) A common astronomical unit for measuring distances, called **parsec**, is based on the parallax method: as its name indicates, it is the distance corresponding to a parallax of 1", amounting to about 3 light-years. Recently, the number of stars for which we have accurate distances has grown a hundrefold as a result of the activity of the satellite specially designed for this task, Hipparcos (high precision parallax collecting satellite), named after the greatest astronomer of antiquity, Hipparchus of Nicea (second centry B.C.E), who measured the celestial positions and brightness of almost a thousand stars and produced the first star catalogue. The satellite Hipparcos, which operated during 1989-1993, gathered data on more than a million nearby stars. But on the astronomical scale, distances that can be directly measured are quite small, and hence *indirect* methods have to be devised, some of which are based on the htory of stellar structure and evolution, as we shall see in Chapter 8.
