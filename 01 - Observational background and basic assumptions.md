# Observational background and basic assumptions

## What is a star?

A star can be defined as a body that satisfies two conditions:

1. it is bound by self-gravity
2. it radiates energy supplied by an internal source.

From the first condition it follows that the shape of such a body must be spherical, for gravity is a spherically symmetric force field. Or, it might be shperoidal, if axissynmmetric forces are also present. The source for radiation is usually nuclear energy released by fusion reactions that take place in stellar interiors, and sometimes gravitational potential energy released in contraction or collapse. By this definition, a planet, for example is not a star, in spite of its stellar appearance, because it shines (mostly) by reflection of solar radiation. Nor can a comet be considered a star, although in early Chinese and Japanese records, comets belong with the "guest stars"--those stars that appeared suddenly in the sky where none had previously been observed. Comets, like planets, shine by reflection of solar radiation and, moreover, their masses are too small for self-gravity to be of importance.

A direct implication of the definition is that stars must evole: as they release energy produced internally, changes necessarily occur in their struction or composition, or both. This is precisely the meaning of evolution. From the above definition we may also infer that the *death* of a star can occur in two ways:

1. violation of the first condition--self-gravity--meaning breakup of the star and scattering of its material into interstellar space, or
2. violation of the second condition--internally supplied radiation of energy--that could result from exhaustion of the nuclear fuel.

In the latter case, the star fades slowly away, while it gradually cools off, radiating the energy accumulated during earlier phases of evolution. Eventually, it will become extinct, disappearing from the field of view of event the most powerful telescopes. This is what we call a dead star. We shall see that most stars end their lives by a combination of these two processes:

1. partial breakup (or shedding of matter) and
2. extinction.

As to the *birth* of a star, this is a complex process, which presents many problems that are still under intensive investigation. We shall deal with this phase only briefly, mainly by pointing out the circumstances under which it is expected to occur.

We shall therefore start pursuing the evolution of a star from the earliest time when both conditions of the definition have been fulfilled, and we shall stop when at least one condition has ceased to be satisfied, completely and irreversibly. Finally, we shall consider the life cycle of stellar populations and the effect of stellar evolution on the evolution of galaxies within which stars reside. Galaxies are large systems of stars (up to 10<sup>11</sup> or so), which also contain interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Many of the stars in a galaxy are aggregated in cluster, the largest among them containing more than 10<sup>5</sup> stars. The object of reference in stellar physics is, naturally, the Sun, and in galactic physics, the Galaxy to which it belongs, also known as the Milky Way galaxy.

## What can we learn from observations?

Astrophysics (the physics of stars) does not lend itself to experimental study, as do the other fields of physical science. We cannot devise and conduct experiments in order to test and validate theories or hypotheses. Validation of a theory is achieved by accumulating observational evidence that supports it and its predictions or inferences. The evidence is derived from events that have occured in the past and are completely beyond our control. The task is rather similar to that of a detective. As a rule of thumb, a theory is accepted as valid (or at least highly probable) if it withstands two radically different and independent observational tests, and of course, as long as no contradictory evidence has been found.

The information we can gather from an individual star is quite restricted. The primary characteristic that can be measured is the **apparent brightness**, which is the amount of radiation from the star falling per unit time on unit area of a collector (usually, a telescope). This radiation flux, which we shall denote _I<sub>obs</sub>_, is not, however, an intrinsic property of the observed star, for it depends on the distance of the star form the observer. The stellar property is the **luminosity** _L_, defined as the amount of energy radiated per unit time--the power of the stellar engine. Since _L_ is also the amount of energy crossing, per unit time, a spherical surface area at the distance _d_ of the observer from the star, the measured apparently brightness is

> _I<sub>obs</sub> = <sup>L</sup>/<sub>4πd<sup>2</sup></sub>_,

and _L_ may be inferred from _I<sub>obs</sub>_ if _d_ is known. The luminosity of a star is usually expressed relative to that of the Sun, the **solar luminosity** _L_<sub>☉</sub> = 3.85×10<sup>26</sup> J s<sup>-1</sup>. Stellar luminosities range between less than 10<sup>-5</sup> _L_<sub>☉</sub> and over 10<sup>5</sup> _L_<sub>☉</sub>.

The surface temperature of a star may be obtained from the general shape of its spectrum, the **continuum**, which is very similar to that of a blackbody. The **effecttive temperature** of a star _T<sub>eff</sub>_ is thus defined as the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same radiation flux. It provides a good approximation to the temperature of the star's outermost layer, called the **photosphere**, where the bulk of the emitted radiation originates. If _R_ is the steallar radius, the surface flux is _<sup>L</sup>/<sub>4πd<sup>2</sup></sub>_, and hence

> _σT<sub>eff</sub><sup>4</sup> = <sup>L</sup>/<sub>4πd<sup>2</sup></sub>_,

where σ is thh Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus

> _L = 4πd<sup>2</sup></sub>σT<sub>eff</sub><sup>4</sup>_.

The surface temperatures of stars range between a few thousand to a few hundred thousand degrees Kelvin (K), the wavelength of maximum radiation λ<sub>max</sub> shifting, according to Wien's law,

> _λ<sub>max</sub>T_ = constant,

from infrared to soft X-rays. The effective temperature of teh Sun is 5780 K. We should bear in mind, however, that conclusions regarding internal temperatures cannot be drawn from surface temperatures withotu a theory.

### Digression on parallax

Note that the only *direct* method of determining distances to stars (and other celestial bodies) is based on the old concept of **parallax**--the angle between the lines of sight of a star from two different positions of the observer. The lines of sight and the line connecting the observer's positions for a triangle, with the star at the apex, as shown in Figure 1.1. The larger the distance to the object, the wider the baseline required for obtaining a discernible parallax: for objects within the solar system, distant points on Earth suffice; for stars, a much larger baseline is needed. This is provided by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, yielding a maximal baseline of ~3×10<sup>11</sup> m, twice the Earth-Sun distance _a_(= 1 AU). Thus, the stellar parallax is obtained by determining a star's position relative to very distant, fixed stars, at an interval of half a year. Even so, the triangle obtained is very nearly isosceles, with almost right base angles, while the parallax _p_, defined as half the apex angle, is less than 1" (the largest known stellar parallax is that of Promixa Centauri--the star closest to our Sun, _p = 0".75_). Consequently, to a good approximation, _d ≈ a/p_. Based on this method, distances of up to about 500 light-years may be directly measured. (One light-year, 94.6x10<sup>15</sup> m, is the distance tranvelled in one year at the speed of light.) A common astronomical unit for measuring distances, called **parsec**, is based on the parallax method: as its name indicates, it is the distance corresponding to a parallax of 1", amounting to about 3 light-years. Recently, the number of stars for which we have accurate distances has grown a hundrefold as a result of the activity of the satellite specially designed for this task, Hipparcos (high precision parallax collecting satellite), named after the greatest astronomer of antiquity, Hipparchus of Nicea (second centry B.C.E), who measured the celestial positions and brightness of almost a thousand stars and produced the first star catalogue. The satellite Hipparcos, which operated during 1989-1993, gathered data on more than a million nearby stars. But on the astronomical scale, distances that can be directly measured are quite small, and hence *indirect* methods have to be devised, some of which are based on the htory of stellar structure and evolution, as we shall see in Chapter 8.
