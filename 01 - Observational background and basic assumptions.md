# Observational background and basic assumptions

## What is a star?

A star can be defined as a body that satisfies two conditions:

1. it is bound by self-gravity
2. it radiates energy supplied by an internal source.

From the first condition it follows that the shape of such a body must be spherical, for gravity is a spherically symmetric force field. Or, it might be shperoidal, if axissynmmetric forces are also present. The source for radiation is usually nuclear energy released by fusion reactions that take place in stellar interiors, and sometimes gravitational potential energy released in contraction or collapse. By this definition, a planet, for example is not a star, in spite of its stellar appearance, because it shines (mostly) by reflection of solar radiation. Nor can a comet be considered a star, although in early Chinese and Japanese records, comets belong with the "guest stars"--those stars that appeared suddenly in the sky where none had previously been observed. Comets, like planets, shine by reflection of solar radiation and, moreover, their masses are too small for self-gravity to be of importance.

A direct implication of the definition is that stars must evole: as they release energy produced internally, changes necessarily occur in their struction or composition, or both. This is precisely the meaning of evolution. From the above definition we may also infer that the *death* of a star can occur in two ways:

1. violation of the first condition--self-gravity--meaning breakup of the star and scattering of its material into interstellar space, or
2. violation of the second condition--internally supplied radiation of energy--that could result from exhaustion of the nuclear fuel.

In the latter case, the star fades slowly away, while it gradually cools off, radiating the energy accumulated during earlier phases of evolution. Eventually, it will become extinct, disappearing from the field of view of event the most powerful telescopes. This is what we call a dead star. We shall see that most stars end their lives by a combination of these two processes:

1. partial breakup (or shedding of matter) and
2. extinction.

As to the *birth* of a star, this is a complex process, which presents many problems that are still under intensive investigation. We shall deal with this phase only briefly, mainly by pointing out the circumstances under which it is expected to occur.

We shall therefore start pursuing the evolution of a star from the earliest time when both conditions of the definition have been fulfilled, and we shall stop when at least one condition has ceased to be satisfied, completely and irreversibly. Finally, we shall consider the life cycle of stellar populations and the effect of stellar evolution
